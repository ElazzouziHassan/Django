# Django Web Framework

A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django makes it easier to build better web applications quickly with less code.

## Description

Django is a free and open-source web framework written in Python that follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern. Its primary goal is to make it easier to build complex, database-driven websites with minimal coding and effort. Django is known for its focus on reusability, ease of use, and rapid development, making it a top choice for web development projects of all sizes.

## Features

- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: Simplifies database interaction.
- **Automatic Admin Interface**: Out-of-the-box admin interface for managing application data.
- **URL Routing**: Flexible URL routing system.
- **Security**: Provides built-in protections against security threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Scalability**: Ideal for small to large web applications.

## Usage
Django uses a model-template-view (MTV) architecture to create web applications. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

1. Define Models: Create models for database tables in models.py.
2. Create Views: Define application logic in views.py.
3. Design Templates: Develop HTML templates to render data and content.
4. URL Configuration: Map URLs to views for routing.

**Example of creating a simple model in models.py**:
```python
  from django.db import models

  class Article(models.Model):
      title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
      content = models.TextField()
      published_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

## Running Migrations
To apply changes to the database schema based on your models, run:
```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
```
